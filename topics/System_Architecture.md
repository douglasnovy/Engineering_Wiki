## Title
**Continuous Emissions Monitoring System (CEMS) Certification and Flow Monitor Leak Check Procedures**

---

## Overview
Continuous Emissions Monitoring Systems (CEMS) are critical for ensuring compliance with environmental regulations by continuously measuring pollutant emissions from industrial sources. Proper installation, certification, and ongoing quality assurance testing—such as flow monitor leak checks—are essential to maintain data accuracy and regulatory compliance. This consolidated entry outlines the certification events for CEMS installations and relocations, as well as the procedures and reporting for flow monitor leak checks.

## Key Concepts

### Continuous Emissions Monitoring System (CEMS)
A CEMS is an integrated system used to continuously collect, record, and report emissions data for pollutants such as SO₂, NOₓ, CO₂, and flow rates from stacks or ducts. CEMS typically include gas analyzers, flow monitors, data acquisition systems, and calibration equipment.

### Certification Events
Certification events are formal procedures required by regulatory agencies (e.g., U.S. EPA) to verify that newly installed or relocated CEMS meet performance specifications before data can be used for compliance reporting.

### Flow Monitor Leak Check
A flow monitor leak check is a quality assurance test designed to verify the integrity of the flow measurement system. It ensures that leaks in the sampling system do not compromise measurement accuracy.

## Technical Details

### CEMS Certification Events
- **Event Types**:
  - **305 – Flow Monitoring System Initial Certification**: Required when a new flow monitoring system is installed or relocated.
  - **125 – Gas Monitoring System Initial Certification**: Required for gas analyzers measuring pollutants such as SO₂, NOₓ, or CO₂.
- **Typical Certification Process**:
  1. **Installation or Relocation** of CEMS components.
  2. **Initial Certification Testing** according to EPA Performance Specifications (e.g., PS-1 for SO₂, PS-2 for NOₓ, PS-6 for CO₂, PS-11 for flow).
  3. **Data Review and Validation** by plant personnel and regulatory agencies.
  4. **Conditional Periods** may apply if certification is pending but data collection has begun.
- **Example Report Data**:
  - Plant: Pine Plant
  - Report Period: 07/01/2012 – 10/12/2012
  - Multiple system IDs and component IDs certified during the period.

### Flow Monitor Leak Check Procedure
- **Purpose**: To detect leaks that could cause erroneous flow readings.
- **Parameters**:
  - System ID: Unique identifier for the monitoring system.
  - Parameter Code: Identifies the specific measurement parameter (e.g., S1CPFLOW).
  - Component ID: Identifies the physical monitoring device.
  - Unit ID: Identifies the stack or duct being monitored.
- **Test Data**:
  - Date and hour of test.
  - Status (Pass/Fail).
  - Test Number and Reason (e.g., QA for quality assurance).
  - Grace Period indicator (whether the test was performed within regulatory grace period).
- **Example Report Data**:
  - Plant: STONEMAN
  - Report Period: 04/01/2013 – 05/24/2013
  - Test Number: EPA007-14032
  - Status: Pass

## Best Practices

1. **Plan Certification Events in Advance**  
   Coordinate installation and certification schedules to minimize downtime and ensure compliance deadlines are met.

2. **Follow EPA Performance Specifications**  
   Use the correct performance specification for each pollutant and measurement type.

3. **Maintain Detailed Records**  
   Keep comprehensive logs of certification events, including system IDs, component IDs, test codes, and conditional periods.

4. **Conduct Regular Leak Checks**  
   Perform flow monitor leak checks at the frequency required by regulations (often quarterly) and immediately after maintenance.

5. **Validate and Archive Reports**  
   Ensure all test reports are reviewed for accuracy, signed by responsible personnel, and archived for regulatory audits.

6. **Respond to Failures Promptly**  
   Investigate and correct any failed certification or leak check tests before resuming compliance data reporting.
