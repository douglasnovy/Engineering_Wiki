Alright â€” based on your requirements and the provided source documents, Iâ€™ve built a **new, fully interconnected wiki topic** that integrates both calibration correction standards and NOx calculation equations into a single, navigable knowledge hub.  

Hereâ€™s the **"Best Wiki Ever"** version:

---

# **Calibration Correction & NOx Emissions Calculations**  
*(Engineering Standards, Procedures, and Tools)*

---

## **Overview**

This page serves as the **central reference** for **automatic calibration correction** procedures and **NOx emissions calculations** in compliance with **EPA Part 60** and **Part 75** regulations.  

It integrates:
- **Calibration Correction Standards** (Rev 11-01-2021)
- **NOx Calculation Equations** for concentration, emission rates, and mass emissions
- **Contextual tool links** for performing calculations and verifying compliance
- **Cross-links** to related topics such as *Continuous Emissions Monitoring Systems (CEMS)*, *EPA Regulatory Requirements*, and *Analyzer Maintenance Procedures*

**Navigation Tip:**  
If you are new to calibration correction, start with the **Basic Concepts** section, then progress to **Configuration Details**. If you are performing emissions reporting, jump directly to **NOx Emissions Calculations**.

## **1. Purpose and Regulatory Context**

Under **EPA Part 60** and **Part 75**, facilities may use **automatic calibration correction** to adjust analyzer readings based on daily calibration results. This ensures:
- Accurate emissions reporting
- Compliance with regulatory limits
- Early detection of analyzer drift

**Key Regulatory Points:**
- All adjustments must be **recorded** and traceable
- Corrections can be **reset** after each calibration
- Corrections can be **disabled** when necessary
- Alarms should be configured for excessive adjustment levels

**Related Reading:**  
- [EPA Part 75 Continuous Emissions Monitoring Requirements](wiki:EPA_Part_75_CEMS)  
- [Daily Calibration Procedures for CEMS](wiki:Daily_Calibration_CEMS)  
- [Analyzer Drift Detection and Correction](wiki:Analyzer_Drift_Correction)

## **2. Calibration Correction Basics**

Calibration correction adjusts analyzer readings based on the difference between **expected reference values** and **actual calibration results**.

**Core Parameters:**
- **Expected Span** (default: 1)
- **Expected Zero** (default: 0)
- **Span Result** (default: 1)
- **Zero Result** (default: 0)

**Calculation Process:**
1. Perform daily calibration (zero and span checks)
2. Calculate **zero offset** and **gain** based on differences
3. Apply correction factors to analyzer readings
4. Log adjustments for compliance

**Tool Integration:**  
Use the **Calibration Correction Calculator** *(spreadsheet tool)* to:
- Input daily calibration results
- Automatically compute zero offset and gain
- Generate compliance-ready adjustment logs

## **3. Configuration Details**

To implement calibration correction in your monitoring system:

- **Write Constants at End of Phase:** Set to **NO**  
  This ensures each daily calibration is evaluated against the previous correction values before updating.

- **Pseudo Digital Input/Output:**  
  Configure a control to **disable gain/offset** when required (e.g., during maintenance).

- **Alarm Configuration:**  
  Set alarms when correction exceeds agreed thresholds (e.g., > 2x performance specification drift).

**Related Procedures:**  
- [CEMS Alarm Configuration Guidelines](wiki:CEMS_Alarm_Setup)  
- [Digital I/O Integration for Analyzer Control](wiki:Digital_IO_Analyzer_Control)

## **4. NOx Emissions Calculations**

Accurate NOx reporting requires multiple calculation methods depending on measurement basis (dry/wet) and reporting format (ppm, lb/mmBtu, lb/hr).

### **4.1 NOx Concentration**
- **Dry Basis (ppmvd)**: Corrects measured NOx to a reference oxygen concentration
- **Wet Basis (ppm)**: Uses measured wet gas concentrations

**Equation Example (Dry Basis Correction):**
\[
NOX_{COR} = Cd \times \frac{20.9 - O2_{correction}}{20.9 - O2_{actual}}
\]

---

### **4.2 NOx Emission Rate (lb/mmBtu)**
Multiple formulas exist depending on fuel type and measurement basis:

**Dry Basis (19-1/F-5):**
\[
E = K \times Cd \times Fd
\]
Where:
- \(K = 1.194 \times 10^{-7}\)
- \(Cd\) = NOx concentration (ppm, dry)
- \(Fd\) = Dry F-factor (dscf/mmBtu)

**Wet Basis (19-7/F-6):**
\[
E = K \times Cw \times Fc
\]
Where:
- \(Cw\) = NOx concentration (ppm, wet)
- \(Fc\) = Carbon-based F-factor (scf COâ‚‚/mmBtu)

---

### **4.3 NOx Mass Emissions (lb/hr)**
**Equation (F-24A):**
\[
E_{(NOx)h} = ER_{(NOx)h} \times HI_h
\]
Where:
- \(ER_{(NOx)h}\) = Hourly average NOx emission rate (lb/mmBtu)
- \(HI_h\) = Hourly average heat input (mmBtu/hr)

---

**Tool Integration:**  
Use the **NOx Emissions Calculator** *(spreadsheet tool)* to:
- Select appropriate equation based on measurement basis
- Input analyzer readings and fuel factors
- Automatically compute emissions rates and mass emissions
