## Enhanced Title
**Comprehensive Guide to 40 CFR Part 75 Monitoring Requirements, Excepted Methods, and Related Regulatory Protocols**

---

## Overview
This guide provides a consolidated and expanded reference for understanding and implementing U.S. EPA 40 CFR Part 75 monitoring requirements, with a focus on **excepted methods** under Appendices D and E, opacity monitoring protocols, Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS) testing, and sorbent trap mercury measurement (Hg STMS). It integrates foundational regulatory training concepts with detailed technical procedures, applicability criteria, and best practices drawn from RMB Consulting & Research, Inc. training materials and ESC’s regulatory training resources.

Part 75 establishes continuous emission monitoring requirements for affected units under the Acid Rain Program (ARP), Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR), and other programs. While most units must install and operate Continuous Emission Monitoring Systems (CEMS), certain gas- and oil-fired units may use **excepted methods** to estimate emissions, avoiding the need for pollutant and flow monitors under specific conditions.

---

## Key Concepts

### 1. Part 75 Monitoring Framework
- **Standard Methods**: Continuous monitoring of SO₂, NOₓ, CO₂, and flow using certified CEMS.
- **Excepted Methods**: Alternative calculation protocols for specific unit types and operating profiles, notably Appendices D and E.
- **Low Mass Emitting (LME) Units**: Special provisions for units with consistently low emissions.

### 2. Appendix D – Fuel Flow-Based Heat Input and SO₂ Estimation
- Applicable only to **gas-fired and oil-fired units**; not permitted for coal-fired sources.
- Uses **fuel flow meters** and fuel sampling/analysis to determine:
  - **Heat Input** via Gross Calorific Value (GCV)
  - **Sulfur Content** of fuel
- Requires **NOₓ CEMS** for NOₓ measurement.
- Preferred over installing SO₂ and flow monitors for qualifying units.
- Historically used in NOₓ Budget and Ozone programs.

### 3. Appendix E – NOₓ Emissions Estimation for Peaking Units
- Optional protocol for **gas- and oil-fired boilers, turbines, and diesel engine peaking units**.
- Applicability:
  - Capacity factor < 10% (3-year average) or < 20% (any one year).
  - Exceeding capacity criteria triggers requirement to install NOₓ CEMS by Dec 31 of the following year.
- Relies on **initial performance testing** to develop NOₓ vs. heat input correlation curves.
- Some states mandate NOₓ CEMS regardless of peaking status.

### 4. Opacity Monitoring
- **Opacity** measures the degree to which emissions obscure background objects; it is an indicator of particulate matter presence, not a pollutant itself.
- Causes: Fly ash, unburned carbon, activated carbon, alkaline sorbents; condensed water vapor excluded for regulatory purposes.
- Measurement Methods:
  - **EPA Method 9**: Visual determination; requires certification every 6 months.
  - **EPA Method 22**: Visual determination of fugitive emissions; minimal training.
  - **ASTM D7520/DCOT**: Digital camera technique; approved for stacks < 7 ft diameter.
- **Continuous Opacity Monitoring Systems (COMS)**: Transmissometers measuring light transmittance through stack gases.

### 5. MATS Quarterly Testing & LEE Qualification
- Applies to coal-fired, IGCC, oil-fired, and pet coke-fired units.
- Testing requirements vary by fuel type and compliance option:
  - PM or metals (Method 5 or 29)
  - HCl (Method 26A or OTM-40)
  - HF (Method 26A)
  - SO₂ RATA (Method 6C)
  - Hg RATA (Method 30B)
- **LEE (Low Emitting EGU) Qualification**: Demonstrates emissions consistently below thresholds.

### 6. Hg STMS – Sorbent Trap Mercury Measurement
- **Performance Specification 12B** governs QA/QC for sorbent trap systems.
- Manual, long-term integrated sampling (up to 15 operating days).
- Paired three-section traps:
  - Section 1: Primary Hg capture
  - Section 2: Breakthrough check
  - Section 3: Spiked for QA/QC
- Measures Hg mass captured per sample volume.

## Technical Details

### Appendix D Implementation
1. Install and calibrate **fuel flow meters**.
2. Conduct fuel sampling for GCV and sulfur content.
3. Use DAHS to calculate hourly heat input and SO₂ emissions.
4. Maintain ECMPS-compliant records.

### Appendix E Implementation
1. Verify unit meets peaking capacity factor criteria.
2. Perform initial stack testing to develop NOₓ correlation curve.
3. Input correlation into DAHS for ongoing NOₓ estimation.
4. Monitor capacity factor annually to ensure continued eligibility.

### Opacity Monitoring
- For Method 9: Position observer at fixed location relative to plume; record 24 readings over 6 minutes.
- For COMS: Ensure proper alignment and calibration; account for moisture interference.

### MATS Testing
- Schedule quarterly/annual tests per fuel type.
- Notify regulatory agencies per Part 63 General Provisions.
- Select appropriate methods based on installed monitoring equipment.

### Hg STMS
- Operate paired sorbent traps with controlled flow rate.
- Analyze trap sections for Hg content.
- Apply PS-12B QA/QC criteria, including breakthrough and spike recovery checks.

---

## Best Practices
- **Appendix D/E**: Use high-quality, calibrated fuel flow meters; maintain rigorous fuel sampling protocols.
- **Opacity**: Train observers thoroughly; maintain COMS in optimal condition.
- **MATS**: Align testing schedules with maintenance outages to minimize operational disruption.
- **Hg STMS**: Use consistent sampling durations; ensure moisture removal systems are functioning.

---

## Implementation Examples
- **Appendix D**: A gas-fired turbine replaces SO₂ CEMS with fuel flow-based calculations, reducing maintenance costs.
- **Appendix E**: An oil-fired peaking unit uses NOₓ correlation curves to comply without installing NOₓ CEMS.
- **Opacity**: A coal plant integrates COMS data into DAHS for real-time compliance tracking.
- **MATS**: A pet coke-fired unit qualifies as LEE, reducing testing frequency.
- **Hg STMS**: A cement plant uses sorbent traps to meet Hg monitoring requirements under PS-12B.

---

## Troubleshooting
- **Appendix D/E**: Erratic heat input values may indicate faulty fuel flow meter calibration.
- **Opacity**: Sudden opacity spikes may result from fuel quality changes or malfunctioning particulate controls.
- **MATS**: Missed test deadlines can trigger noncompliance penalties; maintain a compliance calendar.
- **Hg STMS**: Breakthrough in Section 2 indicates insufficient sorbent capacity or excessive sampling duration.

---

## Source Integration Notes
- **New Information Added**:
  - Detailed applicability and equipment requirements for Appendices D and E.
  - Opacity measurement methods and COMS technology.
  - MATS quarterly testing protocols by fuel type.
  - Hg STMS procedures under PS-12B.
- **Conflicts Resolved**:
  - Clarified that Appendices D/E apply only to gas/oil units; excluded coal applicability.
  - Harmonized capacity factor criteria for Appendix E with state-specific CEMS requirements.
- **Content Enhanced**:
  - Expanded technical details for implementation.
  - Added best practices and troubleshooting guidance.
  - Integrated examples from training materials for practical context.

If you’d like, I can create **flow diagrams** showing decision paths for choosing between standard CEMS and excepted methods under Part 75, which would make this guide even more actionable for compliance engineers. Would you like me to add those?
