## Title
**Consolidated Overview of Part 75 Appendix D & E Requirements, Opacity Monitoring, and MATS/Hg Testing Protocols**

---

## Overview
This consolidated entry provides a comprehensive reference for U.S. EPA regulatory requirements under **40 CFR Part 75** (Appendices D and E), **opacity monitoring methods**, and **Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS)** testing protocols, including sorbent trap mercury measurement (Hg STMS). These regulations govern emissions monitoring, reporting, and compliance for electric generating units (EGUs) and other affected sources, with specific provisions for gas- and oil-fired units, peaking units, and coal-fired sources. Understanding these requirements is critical for compliance officers, environmental engineers, and plant operators to ensure accurate emissions measurement, maintain regulatory compliance, and optimize monitoring strategies.

## Key Concepts

### Part 75 Appendix D
- **Applicability**: Gas- and/or oil-fired units; cannot be used for coal-fired sources.
- **Purpose**: Allows use of fuel flow data and fuel analysis in lieu of continuous SO₂ and flow monitors to determine hourly SO₂ emissions and heat input.
- **Historical Use**: Common in NOₓ Budget and NOₓ Ozone Programs.
- **Measurement Basis**:
  - Fuel flow meters for heat input.
  - Fuel sampling for gross calorific value (GCV) and sulfur content.
  - Requires NOₓ Continuous Emissions Monitoring Systems (CEMS).

### Part 75 Appendix E
- **Applicability**: Gas- and oil-fired boilers, turbines, and diesel engine peaking units.
- **Capacity Factor Limits**:
  - <10% (3-year average) or <20% (any one year).
  - Exceeding limits requires NOₓ CEMS installation by December 31 of the following year.
- **Purpose**: Optional NOₓ emissions estimation protocol for peaking units; NOₓ CEMS not required if criteria met.
- **Measurement Basis**:
  - Stack test results to develop NOₓ vs. heat input correlation.
  - Fuel flow meters and DAHS (Data Acquisition and Handling Systems).

### Opacity Monitoring
- **Definition**: Degree to which emissions reduce light transmission and obscure background objects; not a pollutant itself.
- **Causes**: Particulate matter (fly ash, unburned carbon, sorbents) and condensed water vapor (excluded for regulatory purposes).
- **Measurement Methods**:
  - **EPA Method 9**: Visual determination; certified every 6 months.
  - **EPA Method 22**: Visual determination of fugitive emissions; minimal training.
  - **ASTM 7520/DCOT**: Digital camera technique; approved for stacks <7 ft diameter.
- **COMS Technology**: Continuous Opacity Monitoring Systems (transmissometers) measure light transmittance through stack gases.

### MATS Quarterly Testing & LEE Qualification
- **Applicability**: Coal-fired, IGCC, liquid oil-fired, and pet coke-fired units.
- **Testing Requirements**:
  - Quarterly PM or metals (Method 5 or 29).
  - Quarterly HCl (Method 26A or OTM-40) and/or HF.
  - Annual SO₂ RATA (Method 6C) or Hg RATA (Method 30B).
- **LEE (Low Emitting EGU) Qualification**: Special considerations for reduced testing frequency if emissions consistently below thresholds.

### Hg Sorbent Trap Monitoring Systems (STMS)
- **Regulatory Basis**: Performance Specification 12B (PS-12B), 40 CFR Part 60 Appendix B.
- **Method**: Manual, long-term integrated sampling (up to 15 operating days).
- **Equipment**:
  - Paired three-section carbon sorbent traps.
  - Probe, vacuum pump, heated sample lines, dry gas/mass flow meters, moisture removal, temperature/pressure sensors.
- **Sections**:
  - Section 1: Primary Hg capture.
  - Section 2: Breakthrough determination.
  - Section 3: QA/QC spike with known Hg⁰ concentration.
- **Calculation**: Hg concentration = mass captured / sample volume.

## Technical Details

### Appendix D Procedures
1. Install and calibrate fuel flow meters.
2. Conduct fuel sampling for GCV and sulfur content.
3. Use NOₓ CEMS for NOₓ emissions measurement.
4. Calculate hourly SO₂ emissions and heat input from fuel data.

### Appendix E Procedures
1. Verify unit meets peaking criteria (capacity factor thresholds).
2. Perform initial performance testing to establish NOₓ vs. heat input curve.
3. Use fuel flow meters and DAHS to record operational data.
4. Apply correlation to estimate NOₓ emissions without CEMS.

### Opacity Monitoring Procedures
- **Method 9**: Position observer, take 24 readings every 15 seconds, average over 6 minutes.
- **Method 22**: Observe and record duration of visible emissions.
- **COMS**: Install transmissometer, calibrate, and continuously record opacity data.

### MATS Testing Procedures
- Schedule quarterly and annual tests per fuel type and compliance option.
- Notify regulatory agencies per performance test notification requirements.
- Conduct RATA for applicable CEMS (SO₂, Hg).
- Maintain QA/QC documentation.

### Hg STMS Procedures
1. Install paired sorbent traps in sampling console.
2. Operate pump at known flow rate for up to 15 days.
3. Analyze trap sections for Hg content.
4. Apply PS-12B QA/QC criteria to validate results.

## Best Practices
- **Appendix D/E**:
  - Use Appendix D for gas/oil units to avoid installing SO₂ and flow monitors.
  - Monitor capacity factors closely to maintain peaking unit status under Appendix E.
- **Opacity Monitoring**:
  - Maintain observer certification for Method 9.
  - Use COMS for continuous compliance assurance.
- **MATS Testing**:
  - Align quarterly testing schedules with maintenance outages to minimize operational disruption.
  - Keep detailed records for LEE qualification.
- **Hg STMS**:
  - Ensure proper trap handling to avoid contamination.
  - Follow PS-12B paired train requirements strictly for QA/QC.

Would you like me to also create a **visual compliance decision tree** that integrates Appendix D/E applicability, opacity monitoring method selection, and MATS testing requirements? This could help operators quickly determine which protocols apply to their unit.
