## Title
**Consolidated Overview of 40 CFR Part 75 Excepted Methods, Opacity Monitoring, and MATS Testing Requirements**

---

## Overview
This consolidated entry provides a comprehensive summary of U.S. EPA regulatory requirements under **40 CFR Part 75** for excepted monitoring methods (Appendices D and E, Low Mass Emissions), **opacity monitoring** under NSPS and related standards, and **Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS)** testing protocols, including sorbent trap mercury measurement (Hg STMS). These regulations govern emissions monitoring, testing, and reporting for electric generating units (EGUs) and other affected sources, ensuring compliance with federal air quality programs such as the Acid Rain Program (ARP), NOx Budget Trading Program, Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR), and MATS.

---

## Key Concepts

### Part 75 Excepted Methods
- **Appendix D**: Allows gas- and oil-fired units to determine hourly SO₂ emissions and heat input without continuous SO₂ and flow monitors, using fuel flow meters and fuel sampling/analysis.
- **Appendix E**: Provides an optional NOx emissions estimation protocol for qualifying peaking units, using periodic testing instead of continuous NOx CEMS.
- **Low Mass Emissions (LME)**: Applies to units with low annual emissions, allowing use of default emission factors and simplified heat input determination.

### Opacity Monitoring
- **Opacity**: A measure of the degree to which emissions reduce light transmission and obscure background objects; an indicator of particulate matter emissions.
- **Measurement Methods**:
  - EPA Method 9: Visual determination of opacity from stationary sources.
  - EPA Method 22: Visual determination of fugitive emissions and flare smoke.
  - ASTM D7520 / ALT-082: Digital Camera Opacity Technique (DCOT).
- **Continuous Opacity Monitoring Systems (COMS)**: Transmissometers that measure light transmittance through stack gases.

### MATS Testing Requirements
- **Quarterly and Annual Testing**: PM, metals, HCl, HF, SO₂, and Hg depending on fuel type and compliance option.
- **Hg Sorbent Trap Monitoring Systems (STMS)**: Manual, time-integrated mercury measurement method per PS-12B.

## Technical Details

### Appendix D – Fuel-Based SO₂ and Heat Input Determination
- **Applicability**: Gas- or oil-fired units; not for coal-fired sources.
- **Equipment**:
  - Fuel flow meters (measure volumetric or mass fuel flow).
  - Fuel sampling for gross calorific value (GCV) and sulfur content.
  - NOx CEMS required for NOx measurement.
- **Advantages**: Avoids installation/maintenance of pollutant and flow monitors; historically used in NOx trading programs.
- **Gas Specifications**: Sulfur content limits for pipeline natural gas and other gaseous fuels.

### Appendix E – NOx Emissions Estimation for Peaking Units
- **Applicability Criteria**:
  - Gas/oil-fired boilers, turbines, diesel engines.
  - Capacity factor <10% (3-year average) or <20% (any single year).
- **Protocol**:
  - Initial performance testing to develop NOx vs. heat input correlation.
  - Periodic retesting to maintain correlation validity.
- **CEMS Requirement Trigger**: Exceeding capacity factor thresholds requires NOx CEMS installation by Dec 31 of following year.
- **State Variations**: Some states mandate NOx CEMS regardless of peaking status.

### Low Mass Emissions (LME)
- **Applicability**: Units with low annual emissions.
- **Monitoring**: Default emission factors; fuel flow records or maximum heat input.

### Opacity Monitoring
- **Causes**:
  - Particulate matter (fly ash, unburned carbon, activated carbon, alkaline sorbents).
  - Condensed water vapor (excluded for regulatory opacity).
- **Measurement Methods**:
  - **Method 9**: Certified visual observations; 24 readings over 6 minutes.
  - **Method 22**: Duration of visible emissions; minimal training.
  - **ASTM D7520**: Digital image analysis; approved for stacks <7 ft diameter.
- **COMS Technology**:
  - Measures transmittance (T = I/I₀) of a light beam through stack gases.
  - Applications include stack opacity, water turbidity, and visual range determination.

### MATS Quarterly Testing & LEE Qualification
- **Coal-Fired Units**:
  - Quarterly PM/metals (Method 5 or 29).
  - Quarterly HCl or annual SO₂ RATA (Method 26A, OTM-40, Method 6C).
  - Annual Hg RATA (Method 30B).
- **IGCC Units**:
  - Similar PM/metals and HCl requirements; annual Hg testing.
- **Oil-Fired Units**:
  - Liquid: Quarterly PM/metals, HCl, HF.
  - Solid oil-derived (pet coke): Quarterly PM/metals, HCl or annual SO₂ RATA, annual Hg RATA.
- **Performance Test Notifications**: Must align with Part 63 General Provisions.

### Hg Sorbent Trap Monitoring Systems (STMS)
- **Regulatory Basis**: PS-12B in 40 CFR Part 60, Appendix B.
- **Method**:
  - Paired three-section carbon sorbent traps.
  - Section 1: Primary Hg capture.
  - Section 2: Breakthrough determination.
  - Section 3: QA/QC spike with known Hg⁰.
- **Sampling Duration**: Up to 15 operating days.
- **Equipment**: Probe, vacuum pump, heated lines, dry gas/mass flow meter, moisture removal, temperature/pressure sensors.
- **Calculation**: Hg concentration = mass captured / sample volume.

## Best Practices
1. **Select Appropriate Monitoring Method**:
   - Use Appendix D for qualifying gas/oil units to reduce monitoring complexity.
   - Use Appendix E only if peaking criteria are met; monitor capacity factors closely.
2. **Maintain Calibration and QA/QC**:
   - Regularly calibrate fuel flow meters, CEMS, and COMS.
   - Follow PS-12B QA/QC protocols for sorbent trap sampling.
3. **Document and Report**:
   - Maintain accurate fuel sampling records, test results, and DAHS data.
   - Ensure timely submission to ECMPS or other required reporting systems.
4. **Stay Informed on State Requirements**:
   - Verify if state rules impose stricter monitoring than federal Part 75.
5. **Opacity Monitoring**:
   - Train and certify Method 9 observers every 6 months.
   - Use COMS for continuous compliance assurance.
6. **MATS Testing**:
   - Schedule quarterly/annual tests in advance.
   - Align notifications with applicable Part 63 provisions.

Would you like me to also create a **visual compliance decision tree** that shows when to use Appendix D, Appendix E, LME, or full CEMS based on unit type and capacity factor? That could make this guidance more actionable for operators.
