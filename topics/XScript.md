### Title
XScript Scripting Tool for StackVision - Comprehensive Guide

---

### Overview
XScript is a powerful scripting tool for StackVision that extends the functionality of the legacy Condition Manager (CNDMGR). XScript enables complex automation, data processing, and conditional logic execution within Continuous Emissions Monitoring Systems (CEMS).

This guide consolidates multiple XScript white papers and documentation to provide engineers with a complete reference for implementing and using XScript in their StackVision environments.

---

### Key Features

#### Core Functionality
- **Advanced Scripting**: ProcessNow Task built on Condition Manager foundation
- **Backward Compatibility**: 100% compatible with existing CNDMGR scripts
- **Complex Actions**: Perform sophisticated conditional logic and data manipulation
- **Timestamp Processing**: Evaluate and execute conditions across date ranges and intervals

#### Enhanced Capabilities
- **Variables**: Store values, strings, and dates for complex operations
- **Math Operations**: Perform calculations with proper operator precedence
- **String Manipulation**: Advanced text processing and formatting
- **Date/Time Functions**: Comprehensive temporal data handling
- **Array Operations**: Work with collections of data
- **File I/O**: Read from and write to external files
- **Database Integration**: Direct SQL operations and data queries

---

### Technical Implementation

#### Basic Structure
XScript scripts define a series of if-then-else conditions that are evaluated for each timestamp in a specified interval and date range. Each condition can trigger specific actions when met.

#### Key Differences from CNDMGR
- **Variables**: `VAR` command for data storage and manipulation
- **Math Operations**: Line-by-line evaluation with proper operator precedence
- **String Functions**: Advanced text processing capabilities
- **Error Handling**: Improved debugging and error reporting
- **Performance**: Optimized execution for large datasets

#### Common Use Cases
- **Data Validation**: Automated quality assurance checks
- **Alarm Generation**: Intelligent alerting based on complex conditions
- **Report Generation**: Automated report creation and distribution
- **Data Correction**: Automated data adjustment and normalization
- **System Integration**: Interface with external systems and databases

---

### Best Practices

#### Script Development
- Use meaningful variable names for clarity
- Comment complex logic sections
- Test scripts with sample data before production deployment
- Implement proper error handling

#### Performance Optimization
- Minimize database queries in loops
- Use appropriate data types for variables
- Consider execution frequency and resource impact
- Monitor script performance and adjust as needed

#### Maintenance
- Document script purpose and logic
- Version control all script changes
- Regular review and optimization
- Backup critical scripts

---

### Integration with StackVision

#### ProcessNow Tasks
XScript operates as a specialized ProcessNow Task with enhanced capabilities:
- Scheduled execution based on time intervals
- Integration with StackVision data sources
- Output to logs, databases, and external systems

#### Data Sources
- Real-time CEMS data streams
- Historical data archives
- External database connections
- File-based data imports

---

### Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues
- **Variable Scope**: Ensure variables are properly initialized
- **Math Precision**: Use appropriate data types for calculations
- **String Encoding**: Handle special characters properly
- **Database Connections**: Verify connection strings and permissions

#### Debug Tools
- XScript logging capabilities
- StackVision debug mode
- Variable inspection commands
- Execution trace options
