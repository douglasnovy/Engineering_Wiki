## Title
**CO₂ Control Chart Configuration and Methodology for Emissions Monitoring**

---

## Overview
Control charts are a statistical process control tool used to monitor, detect, and address variations in emissions measurement systems, particularly for CO₂. In emissions monitoring, they help identify potential issues such as sampling system in-leakage or other monitoring system problems that can lead to under-reporting of emissions. By tracking CO₂ concentration data over time within defined load bins, operators can detect unusual shifts in measurements before formal testing (e.g., RATA) reveals them—reducing compliance risks and avoiding costly penalties.

## Key Concepts

### Control Chart Fundamentals
- **Purpose**: Monitor, control, and improve process performance by studying variation over time.
- **Components**:
  1. **Data Points** – Average measurements over defined intervals (e.g., daily averages).
  2. **Center Line** – Overall mean of the dataset.
  3. **Upper and Lower Control Limits (UCL/LCL)** – Statistical thresholds beyond which variation is considered unusual.
- **Benefits**:
  - Detects and monitors process variation.
  - Differentiates between common and special causes of variation.
  - Provides a common language for discussing process performance.
  - Supports consistent, predictable process performance.

### Load Bins
- **Definition**: Narrow operating bands (e.g., MW/10) used to reduce variability caused by changing operating conditions.
- **Purpose in CO₂ Monitoring**: Ensures data comparisons are made under similar operating conditions, increasing sensitivity to anomalies.

### RATA (Relative Accuracy Test Audit)
- **Role**: Formal test of emissions measurement accuracy, typically conducted annually.
- **Control Chart Complement**: Charts can detect issues between RATA events.

## Technical Details

### System Configuration (StackVision)
To enable CO₂ control chart reporting:
1. **Enable Load Bin Calculations**:
   - In StackVision, go to **Configuration → StackStudio → Plant-Sources-Parameters**.
   - On the *Part 75 Settings* tab, check:
     - *Parameter Daily Record?*
     - *Load Range Enabled?*
2. **Configure Daily ProcessNow Sequence**:
   - In StackStudio, go to **ProcessNow → Sequences**.
   - Select the daily sequence and ensure **Task PDR** is enabled.
   - If the *Parameters* field is blank, all parameters are included; otherwise, ensure CO₂ is checked.
3. **Apply Changes**: Commit updates to the StackVision Server.
4. **Verify Load Bin Selection**:
   - In DataLab, check the *Load Range* field under *Fields → Part 75*.

### Data Requirements
- **Hourly CO₂ concentration data** (control parameter due to low variability in a given load band).
- **Load Bin data**.
- **MODC (Monitoring Operating Data Codes)**.
- **Date of last CO₂ RATA**.

### EPA Methodology Steps
1. **Identify Load Bin**:
   - Focus on the most-used load bin for maximum data availability.
   - Optionally evaluate multiple bins to check load dependency.
2. **Baseline Creation**:
   - Use 30 days of daily CO₂ averages (≥6 valid hours/day).
   - Calculate mean and standard deviation.
3. **Control Limits**:
   - UCL = Mean + (k × Standard Deviation).
   - LCL = Mean − (k × Standard Deviation).
4. **Ongoing Monitoring**:
   - Compare new daily averages against control limits.
   - Investigate points outside limits for potential system issues.

### Example Workflow (Lowman_CS4 Case)
- Perform **Load Range Analysis** in StackVision for 1 year to determine normal range.
- Export RATA data and CO₂/unit load data from DataLab.
- Filter for normal load range.
- Retrieve 30 days post-RATA and quarter-to-date data.
- Separate date/hour fields in Excel for analysis.
- Calculate baseline mean, standard deviation, and control limits.

## Best Practices
- **Regular Baseline Updates**: Refresh baseline statistics after each RATA or significant operational change.
- **Multiple Load Bin Analysis**: Evaluate more than one load bin to detect load-dependent anomalies.
- **Data Quality Checks**: Ensure ≥6 valid hours/day for inclusion in daily averages.
- **Automated Monitoring**: Use StackVision’s automated sequences to reduce manual errors.
- **Investigate Outliers Promptly**: Points outside control limits should trigger immediate review.
- **Documentation**: Maintain clear records of configuration settings, baselines, and findings for compliance audits.

If you’d like, I can also create a **visual workflow diagram** that integrates the StackVision configuration, EPA methodology, and Excel analysis steps into a single process map for operators. Would you like me to prepare that?
