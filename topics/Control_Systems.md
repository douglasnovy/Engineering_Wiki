## Title
**CO₂ Control Chart Configuration and Methodology for Emissions Monitoring**

---

## Overview
Control charts are a statistical process control tool used to monitor, detect, and address anomalies in emissions data, particularly CO₂ concentration measurements. In the context of environmental compliance, they help identify potential sampling system in-leakage or other monitoring system issues that can lead to under-reported emissions — a problem that can result in significant regulatory penalties. By combining proper system configuration with a standardized methodology, facilities can ensure accurate, timely detection of data irregularities and maintain compliance with EPA requirements.

## Key Concepts

### Control Charts
A control chart is a graphical representation of process data over time, featuring:
- **Data points**: Average measurements over defined intervals (e.g., daily averages).
- **Center line**: The overall mean of the dataset.
- **Upper and lower control limits (UCL/LCL)**: Statistical thresholds indicating when data points are unlikely under normal conditions.

Control charts differentiate between:
- **Common cause variation**: Normal, inherent process variability.
- **Special cause variation**: Unusual shifts indicating potential problems.

### Load Bins
Load bins categorize operating conditions into narrow bands (e.g., MW ranges) to reduce variability caused by load changes. Evaluating data within a single load bin improves sensitivity to anomalies in emissions data.

### RATA (Relative Accuracy Test Audit)
RATA tests validate emissions monitoring systems and are typically performed annually. Control charts provide a means to detect issues between RATA events.

## Technical Details

### 1. System Configuration (StackVision)
To enable CO₂ control chart reporting:
1. **Enable Load Bin Calculations**:
   - In StackVision, open **StackStudio** → *Plant-Sources-Parameters*.
   - On the *Part 75 Settings* tab, check:
     - **Parameter Daily Record?**
     - **Load Range Enabled?**
2. **Configure Daily ProcessNow Sequence**:
   - In StackStudio, go to **ProcessNow-Sequences**.
   - Select the daily sequence and ensure **Task PDR** is enabled.
   - Include the desired parameter in the PDR list.
3. **Apply Changes**:
   - Click the apply icon to update the StackVision Server.
4. **Verify Load Bin Selection**:
   - Use DataLab to check the *Load Range* field for the parameter.

### 2. Data Requirements
For EPA methodology:
- Hourly CO₂ concentration data
- Load bin data
- MODC (Monitor Operating Data Codes)
- Date of last CO₂ RATA

### 3. EPA Control Chart Methodology
**Step 1: Identify Load Bin**
- Select the most-used load bin to maximize data availability.
- Optionally, evaluate multiple bins to check load dependency.

**Step 2: Establish Baseline**
- Retrieve daily average CO₂ concentration for 30 days post-RATA.
- Ensure at least 6 valid operating hours per day.
- Calculate baseline mean and standard deviation.

**Step 3: Calculate Control Limits**
- UCL = Baseline mean + (k × standard deviation)
- LCL = Baseline mean − (k × standard deviation)
  *(k is typically 3 for 3σ limits)*

**Step 4: Ongoing Monitoring**
- Compare current daily averages to control limits.
- Investigate points outside limits or sustained shifts toward limits.

### 4. Data Processing Workflow (Lowman_CS4 Example)
1. Perform load range analysis in StackVision for 1 year to determine normal range.
2. Export RATA data from DataLab to Excel.
3. Retrieve CO₂ PPM and unit load for 30 days after RATA.
4. Filter data for normal load range.
5. Export quarter-to-date CO₂ and load data.
6. Separate date/hour fields in Excel for analysis.
7. Apply control chart calculations.

## Best Practices
- **Narrow Load Bands**: Always evaluate within a consistent load bin to minimize variability.
- **Frequent Monitoring**: Run control chart evaluations regularly, not just post-RATA.
- **Data Validation**: Ensure at least 6 valid hours per day for daily averages.
- **Multiple Load Bins**: Check across bins to detect load-dependent anomalies.
- **Automated Alerts**: Configure StackVision to flag data outside control limits.
- **Historical Comparison**: Compare current data to multiple past baselines for trend analysis.

If you’d like, I can also create a **visual workflow diagram** that integrates the StackVision configuration, EPA methodology, and Lowman example into a single operational process map. Would you like me to do that?
