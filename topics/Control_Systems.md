## Title
**CO₂ Control Chart Configuration and Methodology for Emissions Monitoring**

---

## Overview
Control charts are a statistical process control tool used to monitor, detect, and address variations in emissions data—particularly CO₂ concentration—over time. In the context of environmental compliance, they help identify potential issues such as sampling system in-leakage or other monitoring system problems that can lead to under-reporting of emissions. Early detection through control charts can prevent costly penalties and ensure regulatory compliance with EPA standards.

This consolidated guide combines configuration instructions, EPA methodology, data handling procedures, and best practices for implementing CO₂ control charts using StackVision and DataLab.

## Key Concepts

### Control Chart Fundamentals
- **Purpose**: Monitor, control, and improve process performance by studying variation.
- **Components**:
  1. **Data Points** – Average measurements over time intervals.
  2. **Center Line** – Overall mean of the dataset.
  3. **Upper/Lower Control Limits (UCL/LCL)** – Statistical thresholds indicating unusual variation.
- **Variation Types**:
  - **Common Cause**: Natural process variation.
  - **Special Cause**: Unusual variation requiring investigation.

### Emissions Monitoring Context
- **CO₂ Concentration**: Selected as the control parameter due to low variability within a given load band.
- **Load Bins**: Narrow operating bands used to minimize variability from changing operating conditions.
- **RATA (Relative Accuracy Test Audit)**: Annual test to verify monitoring system accuracy; control charts provide interim monitoring between RATAs.

## Technical Details

### 1. System Configuration (StackVision)
To enable CO₂ control chart reporting:
1. **Enable Load Bin Calculations**:
   - Navigate to **Configuration → StackStudio → Plant-Sources-Parameters**.
   - On the **Part 75 Settings** tab, check:
     - *Parameter Daily Record?*
     - *Load Range Enabled?*
2. **Configure Daily ProcessNow Sequence**:
   - Go to **ProcessNow → Sequences**.
   - Select the daily sequence and ensure **Task PDR** is enabled.
   - Include the CO₂ parameter in the PDR list (or leave blank to include all).
3. **Apply Changes**:
   - Click the apply icon to update the StackVision Server.
4. **Verify Load Bin Selection**:
   - In DataLab, add the *Load Range* field from **Fields → Part 75** to confirm correct bin selection.

---

### 2. EPA Control Chart Methodology
**Data Requirements**:
- Hourly CO₂ concentration data.
- Load bin data.
- MODC (Monitor Operating Data Codes).
- Date of last CO₂ RATA.

**Procedure**:
1. **Identify Load Bin**:
   - Focus on the most-used load bin for maximum data availability.
   - Optionally evaluate multiple bins to check load dependency.
2. **Create Baseline**:
   - Use 30 days of daily CO₂ averages (≥6 valid hours/day).
   - Calculate mean and standard deviation.
3. **Set Control Limits**:
   - UCL = Mean + (k × Standard Deviation).
   - LCL = Mean − (k × Standard Deviation).
4. **Evaluate Data**:
   - Plot daily averages against control limits.
   - Investigate points outside limits or unusual trends.

### 3. Data Handling and Analysis (Lowman_CS4 Example)
**Preparation Steps**:
1. **Load Range Analysis**:
   - Perform 1-year analysis in StackVision to determine normal load range.
2. **Export RATA Data**:
   - From DataLab, select CO₂ PPM and Unit Load for 30 days post-RATA.
   - Filter for normal load range.
3. **Quarter-to-Date Data**:
   - Export CO₂ PPM and Unit Load for the current quarter.
   - Filter for normal load range.
4. **Data Formatting**:
   - Separate date and hour fields in Excel.
   - Calculate daily averages and operational hours.
   - Apply control chart formulas for UCL/LCL.

---

## Best Practices
- **Consistent Load Bin Selection**: Always use the same load bin for baseline and ongoing monitoring to ensure comparability.
- **Data Quality Checks**: Verify at least 6 valid operational hours per day before including in analysis.
- **Multiple Bin Analysis**: Evaluate more than one load bin to detect load-dependent anomalies.
- **Regular Updates**: Recalculate baseline after each RATA to account for system changes.
- **Automated Monitoring**: Use StackVision’s automation features to streamline data collection and chart generation.
- **Investigate Outliers Promptly**: Points outside control limits may indicate equipment issues, calibration drift, or sampling system leaks.

Would you like me to also include **a visual workflow diagram** showing the process from data collection to control chart evaluation? This could make the methodology easier to follow for operators.
