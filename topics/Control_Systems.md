## Title
**CO₂ Control Chart Configuration and Methodology for Emissions Monitoring**

---

## Overview
Control charts are a statistical process control tool used to monitor, detect, and diagnose variations in emissions data, particularly CO₂ concentrations, in order to identify potential issues such as sampling system in-leakage or other monitoring system problems. These issues can lead to under-measurement of emissions, which may result in regulatory non-compliance and significant financial penalties. By combining proper system configuration with rigorous data analysis, facilities can proactively detect anomalies before they are confirmed by annual Relative Accuracy Test Audits (RATA).

## Key Concepts

### Control Charts
A control chart is a graphical representation of process data over time, featuring:
- **Data points**: Average measurements over defined intervals (e.g., daily averages).
- **Center line**: The overall mean of the dataset.
- **Upper and Lower Control Limits (UCL/LCL)**: Statistical thresholds beyond which data points are considered unusual or indicative of potential problems.

### Load Bins
Load bins categorize operating conditions into narrow bands (e.g., MW ranges) to reduce variability caused by changes in load. Evaluating data within a single load bin improves the sensitivity of the control chart to detect anomalies.

### CO₂ as a Control Parameter
CO₂ concentration is often used due to its relatively low variability within a given load band, making it a stable indicator for detecting deviations.

## Technical Details

### 1. System Configuration (StackVision / StackStudio)
To enable CO₂ control chart reporting:
1. **Enable Load Bin Calculations**:
   - In StackVision, open **StackStudio** → *Plant-Sources-Parameters*.
   - On the *Part 75 Settings* tab, check:
     - **Parameter Daily Record?**
     - **Load Range Enabled?**
2. **Configure Daily ProcessNow Sequence**:
   - In StackStudio, go to *ProcessNow-Sequences*.
   - Select the daily sequence and ensure **Task PDR** is enabled.
   - If the *Parameters* field is blank, all parameters are included; otherwise, ensure CO₂ is checked.
3. **Apply Changes**:
   - Click the *Apply* icon to update the StackVision Server.
4. **Verify Load Bin Selection**:
   - In DataLab, view the *Load Range* field (Fields → Part 75) to confirm the correct bin number.

### 2. Data Requirements
For EPA-style control chart analysis:
- **Hourly CO₂ concentration data**
- **Load Bin data**
- **MODC (Monitor Operating Data Codes)**
- **Date of last CO₂ RATA**

---

### 3. EPA Control Chart Methodology
**Step 1: Identify Load Bin**
- Select the most-used load bin to maximize available data.
- Optionally, evaluate multiple bins to check load dependency.

**Step 2: Establish Baseline**
- Use 30 days of daily CO₂ averages (≥6 valid hours/day).
- Calculate:
  - **Baseline Mean**
  - **Standard Deviation**

**Step 3: Set Control Limits**
- UCL = Mean + (k × Standard Deviation)
- LCL = Mean − (k × Standard Deviation)
  - *k* is typically 3 for ±3σ limits.

**Step 4: Monitor and Detect**
- Plot daily averages against control limits.
- Investigate points outside limits or unusual trends.

### 4. Practical Workflow (Lowman_CS4 Example)
1. **Determine Normal Load Range**:
   - Perform Load Range Analysis in StackVision for 1 year.
2. **Export RATA Data**:
   - From DataLab, export CO₂ PPM and Unit Load for 30 days post-RATA.
   - Filter for normal load range.
3. **Export Quarter-to-Date Data**:
   - Retrieve CO₂ PPM and Unit Load for the current quarter.
   - Filter for normal load range.
4. **Data Preparation**:
   - Separate date and hour fields in Excel.
   - Calculate daily averages and control limits.
5. **Chart Creation**:
   - Plot averages with UCL/LCL for visual monitoring.

---

## Best Practices
- **Regular Baseline Updates**: Refresh baseline statistics after each RATA to account for system changes.
- **Multiple Load Bin Analysis**: Evaluate more than one load bin to detect load-dependent anomalies.
- **Data Quality Checks**: Ensure ≥6 valid hours per day for inclusion in daily averages.
- **Automated Monitoring**: Use StackVision’s automation to reduce manual errors.
- **Investigate Early**: Any point outside control limits should trigger an immediate review of monitoring systems.

Would you like me to also include a **sample control chart diagram** in the consolidated document to visually illustrate the methodology? This could help make the procedure more intuitive.
