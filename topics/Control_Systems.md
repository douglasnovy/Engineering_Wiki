## Title
**CO₂ Control Chart Configuration and Methodology for Emissions Monitoring**

---

## Overview
Control charts are a statistical process control tool used to monitor, detect, and diagnose anomalies in emissions data, particularly CO₂ concentration measurements. In the context of environmental compliance, they help identify potential sampling system in-leakage or other monitoring system issues that can lead to under-reporting of emissions—a problem that may otherwise only be detected during annual Relative Accuracy Test Audits (RATA). Proper configuration of monitoring systems and accurate data analysis are essential for ensuring regulatory compliance, avoiding penalties, and maintaining operational integrity.

## Key Concepts

### Control Chart Fundamentals
- **Purpose**: Monitor, control, and improve process performance by studying variation over time.
- **Components**:
  1. **Data Points** – Average measurements over defined intervals (e.g., daily averages).
  2. **Center Line** – Overall mean of the dataset.
  3. **Upper and Lower Control Limits (UCL/LCL)** – Statistical thresholds indicating when variation is unlikely to be due to normal process behavior.
- **Benefits**:
  - Detect unusual shifts or trends in emissions data.
  - Differentiate between common cause variation (normal) and special cause variation (indicative of problems).
  - Provide a common language for discussing process performance.

### Load Bins
- **Definition**: Narrow operating bands (e.g., MW/10) used to group data for analysis, reducing variability caused by changing operating conditions.
- **Importance**: Evaluating data within a single load bin increases sensitivity to anomalies.

### RATA (Relative Accuracy Test Audit)
- **Role**: Annual test to verify accuracy of emissions monitoring systems.
- **Limitation**: Issues may arise between tests; control charts provide continuous monitoring.

## Technical Details

### System Configuration (StackVision)
1. **Enable Load Bin Calculations**:
   - Navigate to *Configuration → StackStudio → Plant-Sources-Parameters*.
   - On the *Part 75 Settings* tab, check:
     - **Parameter Daily Record?**
     - **Load Range Enabled?**
2. **Configure Daily ProcessNow Sequence**:
   - Go to *ProcessNow → Sequences*.
   - Select the daily sequence and ensure **Task PDR** is enabled.
   - Include the desired parameter in the PDR list.
3. **Apply Changes**:
   - Click the apply icon to update the StackVision Server.
4. **Verify Load Bin Selection**:
   - Use DataLab to check the *Load Range* field under *Fields → Part 75*.

### Data Requirements
- Hourly CO₂ concentration data.
- Load bin data.
- MODC (Monitor Data Certification) codes.
- Date of last CO₂ RATA.

### EPA Methodology for Detecting Under-Reported Emissions
1. **Identify Load Bin**:
   - Focus on the most-used load bin for maximum data availability.
   - Optionally evaluate multiple bins to assess load dependency.
2. **Baseline Creation**:
   - Use 30 days of daily CO₂ averages (≥6 valid hours/day).
   - Calculate mean and standard deviation for baseline period.
3. **Control Limit Calculation**:
   - UCL = Mean + (Standard Deviation × factor).
   - LCL = Mean − (Standard Deviation × factor).
4. **Ongoing Monitoring**:
   - Compare new daily averages to control limits.
   - Investigate deviations beyond limits for potential system issues.

### Example Workflow (Lowman_CS4 CO₂ Control Chart)
1. Perform load range analysis in StackVision for one year.
2. Export RATA data from DataLab to Excel.
3. Retrieve CO₂ PPM and unit load for 30 days post-RATA.
4. Filter unit load for normal range.
5. Export quarter-to-date CO₂ and load data.
6. Separate date/hour fields in Excel for analysis.
7. Calculate averages, standard deviations, and control limits.

## Best Practices
- **Narrow Load Bin Analysis**: Reduces variability and increases detection sensitivity.
- **Regular Baseline Updates**: Refresh baseline data periodically to reflect current operating conditions.
- **Data Validation**: Ensure at least 6 valid operating hours per day for inclusion in averages.
- **Multiple Load Bin Checks**: Run analysis across different bins to detect load-dependent anomalies.
- **Documentation**: Maintain clear records of configuration settings, baseline calculations, and control chart outputs.
- **Prompt Investigation**: Address deviations beyond control limits immediately to prevent compliance issues.

Would you like me to also include **a visual diagram of the control chart workflow** to make this knowledge base entry more user-friendly? This could help operators quickly understand the process from configuration to anomaly detection.
