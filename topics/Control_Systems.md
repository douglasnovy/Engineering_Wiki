## Title
**CO₂ Control Chart Configuration and Methodology for Emissions Monitoring**

---

## Overview
Control charts are a statistical process control tool used in emissions monitoring to detect anomalies such as sampling system in-leakage, which can lead to under-measurement of CO₂ emissions. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and StackVision systems employ control chart methodologies to identify unusual shifts in CO₂ data, enabling early detection of monitoring system problems before annual Relative Accuracy Test Audits (RATA). Proper configuration of load bins, data collection, and analysis procedures is essential for accurate reporting and compliance.

## Key Concepts

### Control Charts
A control chart is a graphical representation of process data over time, consisting of:
- **Data Points**: Average measurements over defined intervals (e.g., daily averages).
- **Center Line**: The overall mean of the dataset.
- **Upper and Lower Control Limits (UCL/LCL)**: Statistical thresholds beyond which data points are considered unusual.

### Purpose in Emissions Monitoring
- Detect and monitor process variation over time.
- Differentiate between common and special causes of variation.
- Provide a tool for ongoing process control and improvement.
- Identify potential under-reporting of emissions due to equipment or sampling issues.

### Load Bins
Load bins group data into narrow operating ranges (e.g., MW/10) to reduce variability caused by changing operating conditions. This allows for more precise detection of anomalies.

## Technical Details

### 1. System Configuration (StackVision)
To enable CO₂ control chart reporting:
1. **Enable Load Bin Calculations**:
   - Navigate to *Configuration → StackStudio → Plant-Sources-Parameters*.
   - On the *Part 75 Settings* tab, check:
     - **Parameter Daily Record?**
     - **Load Range Enabled?**
2. **Configure Daily ProcessNow Sequence**:
   - Go to *ProcessNow → Sequences*.
   - Select the daily sequence and ensure **Task PDR** is enabled.
   - Include the desired parameter in the PDR list.
3. **Apply Changes**:
   - Click the apply icon to update the StackVision Server.
4. **Verify Load Bin Selection**:
   - Use DataLab to check the *Load Range* field under *Fields → Part 75*.

---

### 2. Data Requirements
For EPA methodology and StackVision analysis:
- **Hourly CO₂ concentration data** (control parameter).
- **Load Bin data** (narrow operating bands).
- **MODC data** (Monitor Operating Data Codes).
- **Date of last CO₂ RATA**.

---

### 3. EPA Control Chart Procedure
1. **Identify Load Bin**:
   - Select the most-used load bin for maximum data availability.
   - Optionally evaluate multiple bins to check load dependency.
2. **Baseline Creation**:
   - Use 30 days of daily CO₂ averages (≥6 valid hours/day).
   - Calculate mean and standard deviation.
3. **Set Control Limits**:
   - UCL = Mean + (k × Standard Deviation)
   - LCL = Mean - (k × Standard Deviation)
4. **Monitor for Outliers**:
   - Points outside control limits indicate potential issues.

---

### 4. Data Analysis Workflow (Lowman_CS4 Example)
- Perform load range analysis in StackVision for one year to determine normal range.
- Export RATA data and CO₂/unit load data from DataLab.
- Filter data for normal load range.
- Separate date and hour fields in Excel for analysis.
- Compare post-RATA data with quarter-to-date data to detect deviations.

---

## Best Practices
- **Regular Baseline Updates**: Recalculate mean and control limits after each RATA.
- **Multiple Load Bin Analysis**: Reduces false positives by accounting for load-dependent variability.
- **Data Validation**: Ensure at least 6 valid hours per day for inclusion in daily averages.
- **Automated Monitoring**: Use StackVision’s automated sequences to reduce manual errors.
- **Early Investigation**: Promptly investigate points outside control limits to prevent compliance issues.

Would you like me to also include **a visual example of a CO₂ control chart** with labeled components for training purposes? That could make this consolidated entry more actionable for operators.
