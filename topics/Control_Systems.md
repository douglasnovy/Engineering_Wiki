## Title
**CO₂ Control Chart Configuration and Methodology for Emissions Monitoring**

---

## Overview
Control charts are a statistical process control tool used to monitor, detect, and diagnose variations in emissions data over time. In the context of CO₂ emissions monitoring, they help identify potential issues such as sampling system in-leakage or other monitoring system problems that can lead to under-reporting of emissions. These issues, if undetected, can result in regulatory non-compliance and significant penalties. By combining proper system configuration with EPA-recommended methodologies, facilities can proactively detect anomalies and maintain accurate emissions reporting.

## Key Concepts

### Control Charts
A control chart is a time-series plot that includes:
- **Data points**: Average measurements over defined intervals (e.g., daily averages).
- **Center line**: The overall mean of the dataset.
- **Upper and Lower Control Limits (UCL/LCL)**: Statistical thresholds beyond which data points are considered unusual and potentially indicative of a problem.

### Load Bins
Load bins categorize operational data into narrow ranges of plant load (e.g., MW output) to reduce variability caused by changing operating conditions. Evaluating CO₂ data within a single load bin improves sensitivity to anomalies.

### RATA (Relative Accuracy Test Audit)
RATA tests are periodic (often annual) performance evaluations of emissions monitoring systems. Control charts can detect potential issues between RATA events, providing continuous oversight.

## Technical Details

### 1. System Configuration (StackVision)
To enable CO₂ control chart reporting:
1. **Enable Load Bin Calculations**  
   - In StackVision, navigate to **Configuration → StackStudio → Plant-Sources-Parameters**.
   - On the *Part 75 Settings* tab, check:
     - **Parameter Daily Record?**
     - **Load Range Enabled?**
2. **Configure Daily ProcessNow Sequence**  
   - Go to **ProcessNow → Sequences**.
   - Select the daily sequence and ensure **Task PDR** is enabled.
   - If the *Parameters* field is blank, all parameters are included; otherwise, ensure CO₂ is checked.
3. **Apply Changes**  
   - Click the apply icon to update the StackVision Server.
4. **Verify Load Bin Selection**  
   - In DataLab, view the *Load Range* field under **Fields → Part 75** to confirm correct bin selection.

### 2. EPA Methodology for Detecting Under-Reported Emissions
**Data Requirements:**
- Hourly CO₂ concentration data
- Load bin data
- MODC (Method of Determination Code) data
- Date of last CO₂ RATA

**Procedure:**
1. **Identify Load Bin**  
   - Select the most-used load bin for maximum data coverage.
   - Optionally, evaluate multiple bins to check load dependency.
2. **Create Baseline**  
   - Use 30 days of daily CO₂ averages (≥6 valid hours/day).
   - Calculate mean and standard deviation.
3. **Set Control Limits**  
   - UCL = Mean + (k × Standard Deviation)  
   - LCL = Mean − (k × Standard Deviation)  
     *(k is typically 3 for 3σ limits)*
4. **Monitor Data**  
   - Plot daily averages against control limits.
   - Investigate points outside limits or unusual trends.

### 3. Data Analysis Workflow (Lowman_CS4 Example)
**Preparation:**
- Perform load range analysis in StackVision for 1 year to determine normal operating range.
- Export RATA data and CO₂/unit load data from DataLab.

**Steps:**
1. Retrieve 30 days of CO₂ PPM and unit load data post-RATA.
2. Filter for normal load range.
3. Export quarter-to-date CO₂ and load data.
4. Separate date/hour fields in Excel for analysis.
5. Calculate daily averages, standard deviation, and control limits.
6. Plot control chart for visual inspection.

## Best Practices
- **Consistent Load Bin Selection**: Always analyze data within the same load bin to ensure comparability.
- **Regular Baseline Updates**: Recalculate mean and control limits after each RATA or significant operational change.
- **Data Quality Checks**: Ensure ≥6 valid hours per day for inclusion in daily averages.
- **Multiple Bin Analysis**: If anomalies are load-dependent, evaluating multiple bins can improve diagnosis.
- **Automated Monitoring**: Where possible, automate control chart generation to enable near real-time detection.
- **Investigate Outliers Promptly**: Points outside control limits should trigger immediate review of monitoring equipment and operational conditions.
